# Step 6 – Results Analysis

## What did OpenAI find?
- Revenue concentration: Electronics is the leading category (~43.4% of revenue) and North America is the leading region (~45.7%).
- Pricing signal: Weighted average unit price (~155.54) is much lower than the simple average (~236.40), suggesting a skewed product mix (few expensive items, many cheaper units).
- High-value items: The top product by revenue is a premium item (Canon EOS R5 Camera), indicating that a small number of high-ticket products can strongly influence revenue.

## What surprised me?
- The gap between simple vs. weighted average unit price is large, which suggests the distribution of units sold is dominated by lower-priced items while a few expensive items inflate the simple mean.
- A single-unit sale can appear as a “top product by revenue,” which can mislead conclusions if not considered carefully.

## What was expected?
- Electronics leading revenue is plausible in many online sales datasets.
- Regional revenue dominance (North America) is common depending on the dataset’s market focus.

## How reliable is it?
- Medium reliability: The insights are grounded in computed KPIs, but interpretations (e.g., “pricing strategy adjustments”) are hypotheses.
- Potential bias: Without time trends, customer segmentation, or marketing context, recommendations are directional rather than definitive.
- To improve reliability: add monthly trends, margin/cost data, and statistical checks (outliers, distribution of units and prices).
